    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a survey by the Central Statistics Agency of Indonesia published on November 6, 2023, the unemployment rate in Indonesia is 5.32 percent [[1]](https://www.bps.go.id/id/pressrelease/2023/11/06/2002/tingkat-pengangguran-terbuka--tpt--sebesar-5-32-persen-dan-rata-rata-upah-buruh-sebesar-3-18-juta-rupiah-per-bulan.html). Although this is a decrease from previous years, it remains an issue that needs to be resolved. The results of the study by Pramudjasi and Juliansyah, 2019 in the FEB Unmul Journal [[2]](https://journal.feb.unmul.ac.id/index.php/KINERJA/article/download/5284/472) stated that the population has a significant positive effect on the unemployment rate. This is also confirmed in the research of Sari and Pangestuty, 2022 in  [[3]](https://jdess.ub.ac.id/index.php/jdess/article/download/78/57/373) stating that population growth has an impact on the increase in the Open Unemployment Rate. Various surveys and findings from this academic journal are the background for the Author in trying to analyze what factors have a strong relationship to unemployment, employment, especially factors that are related to high income.\n",

    "This project focuses on the analysis of the \"Adults Income\" dataset with the aim of identifying and predicting factors that have a high correlation, or even contribute to employment, especially the amount of income of a person. In this case, the target feature of this dataset is whether a person's annual income is <50,000 dollars or >= 50,000 dollars per year, so this project will solve the classification case. Although this dataset is taken from the 1996 census data, this dataset still has significant relevance today, due to the general nature of the variables in this dataset and the absence of drastic changes in the components that determine incomedanya perubahan yang drastis pada komponen-komponen penentu penghasilan. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Jepchumba from Microsoft [[4]](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/getting-started-with-using-visual-machine-learning-tools-for/ba-p/3578397), *machine learning* , is a technique that uses advanced mathematics and statistics to recognize patterns in data that do not exist explicitly, and can predict according to the results of these patterns. With the variety of factors (variables) involved in this project, machine learning is the best solution. Identification and prediction of factors will be done by applying data analysis techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and using Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Boosting .\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a small tool to help solve the problem of difficulty in finding work, by analyzing the dynamics of high annual income factors. The results of this project are expected to help the Government and individuals in productive age as additional insight related to this problem, and help these parties to develop society and themselves to improve the quality of life."
